Cameo EA projects and to then interact with one or more Cameo EA models from Ruby code. This inverts control: typically,
the Ruby code is called from within the Cameo EA session via the JSR 232 ScriptEngine interface. This limits the Ruby context
to whichever jRuby version is packaged with Cameo EA and to only the currently open Project within Cameo EA. By running Cameo EA
within the Ruby session, rather than vice versa, the Ruby environment can be whichever is needed to support the choice of
gems and allows the Ruby session to access multiple Cameo EA projects.}
